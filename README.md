# Individual Proyect E-Commerce üì±

In this projects we have to implement an e-commerce platform called Gappllery, where you can find beautiful paintings and photographies.

![Gappllery Logo](src/assets/logog.png)

Step 1 consisted in designing the look with Figma:

- [My Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/file/U35G4p5b1lsH6H5Gu5hXFX/Proyecto-individual?type=design&node-id=21%3A1009&mode=design&t=5UO7oWfqrxsB1cOx-1)

Also create my project in ClickUp:

In step 2, I had to install pnpm package manager instead of npm and Vite frontend tool to start the project.

Step 3 involved installing React and React Router.

With all my tools installed and ready to go, let's build the project!

## Extra tools used ‚ú®

- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
