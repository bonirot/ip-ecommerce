# Individual Proyect E-Commerce

In this projects we have to implement an e-commerce platform with multiples products. The theme of my project is selling paintings and photographies.

The first step was designing the look with Figma:

![Figma Design](src/assets/imagesReadme/figma.webp)

Then I had to install pnpm package manager instead of npm and Vite frontend tool to start the project.

The next step was installing React Dom and React Router Dom (to build the app routes).

Now I had all my tools prepared, let's build the project!

## Extra tools used

- [React Hot Toast](https://react-hot-toast.com)
- [React Icons](https://react-icons.github.io/react-icons/)
